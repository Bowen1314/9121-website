# Falcon Force 9121 Website

This repository hosts the static marketing site for Falcon Force 9121, a FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team based in Columbia, South Carolina. The single-page experience introduces the team’s mission, season highlights, media library, sponsor partnerships, and contact information. The codebase is pure front end, so deployment to platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel is straightforward.

## Features

- **Hero & Navigation** – Bold hero banner with mission statement, call-to-action buttons, and a mobile-friendly navigation drawer.
- **Our Mission** – Three-card overview covering engineering excellence, collaborative culture, and community outreach.
- **Season Spotlight** – Summaries of the current season, strategy focus, milestone cards, and award callouts.
- **Instagram Feed** – Embedded Instagram content with a refresh button; the script loads the Instagram SDK on demand.
- **Media Hub Gallery** – Responsive gallery slots that accept local or remote portraits with consistent portrait framing.
- **Sponsor Showcase** – Portrait sponsor cards featuring logos, tier labels, and customizable descriptions.
- **Contact Section** – Email, address, social links, and an embedded Google Map for quick directions.

## Project Structure

```
├── index.html        # Main page markup
├── css/style.css     # Global styles, responsive layout, and theme variables
├── js/main.js        # Navigation toggle, year updater, gallery helper, Instagram loader
├── imges/            # Local assets (team photos, sponsor logos, etc.)
└── README.md
```

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` directly in a browser to preview the site locally.
2. Upload `index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, and `imges/` to your preferred static hosting platform to go live.

## Customization

- **Text & Imagery** – Edit copy, headings, and image paths in `index.html`.
- **Instagram Embed** – Replace the `data-instgrm-permalink` attribute inside `#instagram-feed` with a link generated by Instagram’s embed tool.
- **Media Gallery** – Swap the inline `background-image` styles on `.gallery-slot__canvas`, or create reusable CSS classes for repeated assets.
- **Sponsor Logos** – Drop portrait logos into `imges/` and update the `<img>` sources inside each sponsor card.
- **Colors & Typography** – Adjust CSS custom properties (`--color-primary`, `--color-secondary`, etc.) at the top of `css/style.css`; fonts load via Google Fonts.
- **Map Embed** – Provide your Google Maps Embed API key inside the iframe `src` to display an interactive map.

## Roadmap Ideas

- Add a team roster, season blog, or FAQ.
- Introduce a lightbox viewer or video playlist in the media hub.
- Connect a form backend (e.g., Formspree) to capture inquiries and sponsorship leads.
- Adopt a build tool such as Vite if you plan to scale the site with additional pages or components.
